## Description

My goal in building this project was to create a multi-page website using HTML and CSS. I decided to build a website pertaining to something I love and have a passion for, which is hairless dogs. 

The website offers information about hairless dogs. There are currently only four breeds featured, but I hope to add more in the future. 

## Technologies Used
HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap

## User Stories
As a prospective dog owner with allergies, I want to evaluate different hairless dog breeds so that I can decide if a hairless dog would be right for me.

As a hairless dog breeder, I want to provide information about hairless dogs so that I can educate my clients on proper hairless dog maintenance and care.  

## Future Improvements

Future improvements that I want to make include (1) fixing the overflow/horizontal scrolling issue on the homepage when in small screen sizes, (2) improving responsiveness of the website, and (3) eventually adding a directory that allows people to search for responsible breeders and shelters in their area to find hairless dogs.
